"""Who is allowed to see content no human has read yet.

Pensum withholds unreviewed quiz items and unreviewed reading passages, because
generation writes them unreviewed and a merge alone must never put an unread
question in front of a child. An administrator is the exception: a draft has to
be readable in place before anyone can judge whether it is fit.

The assertions that matter here are the negative ones. Every other test in this
suite fails loudly when something stops working; these fail loudly when
something starts working for the wrong person.

The draft is a fixture, deliberately, and not a passage from `data/reading/`.
Reviewing content is the normal end of its life, so a gate test anchored to
committed drafts breaks on the day someone does the reviewing -- which is the
one day you least want a red suite and the least useful thing for it to be
telling you.
