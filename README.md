# Pensum

What pupils in Norwegian *grunnskole* are expected to master by the end of each
*klasse*, and quizzes to check whether they do.

Built on **LK20**, the national curriculum, taken directly from
[Udir's open Grep API](https://data.udir.no/kl06/v201906/). Every competence goal
shown here is the official wording, in the *målform* Udir published it in, and
links back to its source record.

> a substitute for a teacher's judgement, and not affiliated with or endorsed by
> Utdanningsdirektoratet. "Passing 2. klasse" here is a friendly proxy, not a
> verdict — see [Honest limits](#honest-limits).

## Norsk

Pensum viser hva elever i norsk grunnskole skal mestre etter hvert hovedtrinn, og
gir quizer for å øve. Innholdet bygger på LK20-kompetansemålene fra
Utdanningsdirektoratet, hentet direkte fra det åpne Grep-APIet. Bokmål er
hovedspråket i grensesnittet; engelsk er også tilgjengelig.

Pensum er et uoffisielt hjelpemiddel, ikke et vurderingsverktøy, og er ikke
tilknyttet Utdanningsdirektoratet.

## How the curriculum is modelled

Udir's own hierarchy, kept deliberately intact so re-verification stays trivial:

```
Subject (læreplan)        MAT01-06, one revision of one subject
└── GoalSet               "etter 2. trinn" — a checkpoint
    └── Goal              a single kompetansemål, with a stable KM code
```

**LK20 defines checkpoints, not years.** Most subjects set goals after 2., 4.,
7. and 10. trinn; matematikk uniquely defines every trinn. Pensum invents no
per-year split — it uses Udir's own `benyttes-paa-aarstrinn`, which states which
school years each checkpoint covers. So a pupil in 1. klasse sees the 2. trinn
goals labelled as what they are working *towards*, and a 2nd-grader sees the same
goals labelled as what they should now master.

**Curricula are revised, and revisions renumber everything.** A goal's KM code is
not stable across revisions — when MAT01-05 became MAT01-06, every code changed
and no goal kept its old identifier. The ingest therefore selects curricula by
*validity date*, never by a hardcoded list, so a revision is a re-run rather than
a rewrite.

## Running it

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/brujoand/pensum:1.0.0
```

No credentials needed — the image is public, like the repo. It carries the
curriculum baked in and needs no network access, no API key and no
configuration. Optional sign-in and score history are the one exception, and
they stay off until configured: see [Accounts and score
history](#accounts-and-score-history).

There is deliberately **no `latest` tag**. A deployment should name the version
it wants; a moving tag makes that impossible to do honestly. Published tags are
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}`, `{major}.{minor}`, `{major}` and the full commit sha.
Releases are cut from Conventional Commits — see
[releases](https://github.com/brujoand/pensum/releases) for what each version
changed.

The running app reports its version at `/healthz`. An image that says `dev` was
built outside the release pipeline.

## Accounts and score history

**Off unless you turn it on.** Run the image as above and Pensum has no accounts,
writes nothing to disk, and forgets every quiz the moment the tab closes. Point
it at an OIDC provider and two things become possible: a pupil can sign in, and
an adult in a nominated group can see how the signed-in pupils have done.

Four properties hold whenever it *is* configured, and they are enforced in code
rather than documented as intent:

- **Signing in is optional, always.** Every quiz works signed out, and an
  anonymous attempt is never recorded — there is nobody to record it against.
  There is no page on the site that requires an account except the admin ones.
- **Only finished quizzes are kept.** An abandoned attempt is not a result and
  leaves nothing behind.
- **A summary, not a transcript.** What is stored is the checkpoint, the score
  and the per-goal tally the pupil's own result page shows. Not which answer was
  given to which question. The tally is what an adult can act on; a log of a
  seven-year-old's individual mistakes is not.
- **The pupil is told.** A signed-in pupil's result page says their score was
  saved and that an adult with access can see it.

Nothing is recorded until **both** switches are on: an OIDC client *and* a
database path. Sign-in without a database is still a site that forgets.

### Configuring it

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PENSUM_OIDC_ISSUER` | Provider base URL, e.g. `https://id.example.com`. Discovery is read from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. |
| `PENSUM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | The client you registered for Pensum. |
| `PENSUM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Its secret. |
| `PENSUM_BASE_URL` | Pensum's own public origin, e.g. `https://pensum.example.com`. Required behind a TLS-terminating proxy — the redirect URI is built from it. |
| `PENSUM_ADMIN_GROUP` | Group whose members may read other people's scores. Default `pensum-admins`. |
| `PENSUM_DATABASE_PATH` | SQLite file for finished attempts, e.g. `/data/pensum.db`. Unset means nothing is recorded. |
| `PENSUM_SESSION_SECRET` | Signs the login cookie. Generated per process when unset, so a restart signs everyone out. |

Sign-in needs all three OIDC values; any fewer and the feature stays off rather
than half-on.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e PENSUM_OIDC_ISSUER=https://id.example.com \
  -e PENSUM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=pensum \
  -e PENSUM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
  -e PENSUM_BASE_URL=https://pensum.example.com \
  -e PENSUM_ADMIN_GROUP=pensum-admins \
  -e PENSUM_DATABASE_PATH=/data/pensum.db \
  -e PENSUM_SESSION_SECRET=... \
  -v pensum-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/brujoand/pensum:1.0.0
```

The container runs as uid 65532, so the mounted volume has to be writable by it.
Without the volume the history is real but lasts until the container is replaced.

### On the provider side

Register a confidential client with:

- redirect URI `https://pensum.example.com/auth/callback` — one, exactly
- scopes `openid profile email groups`
- PKCE (S256) — Pensum always sends a challenge

Then make a group matching `PENSUM_ADMIN_GROUP` and put the adults in it.
Membership is read from the `groups` claim, so granting or revoking admin is done
in the provider and never needs Pensum redeployed. It takes effect when the
person's session next refreshes, not instantly — the group list is read from the
signed login cookie rather than from the provider on every page load.

Any OIDC provider emitting a `groups` claim works; pocket-id is what it is
developed against. For providers that expose groups only from `/userinfo`, Pensum
falls back to asking there once, at sign-in.

### What an admin sees

`/{locale}/admin` lists everyone who has finished at least one quiz while signed
in: name, how many quizzes, an average weighted by question rather than by quiz,
and the date of the last one. Each row opens that pupil's history, with every
attempt broken down by competence goal.

The pages are read-only. There is nothing there to re-grade or delete a child's
record with — for that, the database is one SQLite file and `sqlite3` is a better
tool than a web form anyone can misclick.

## Reviewing drafts

Quiz items, reading passages and writing prompts are committed unreviewed and
withheld until a human marks them `reviewed: true`. Two things can lift that, and they are
different in kind:

- **`PENSUM_INCLUDE_UNREVIEWED=1`** shows drafts to *everyone*. It is for a
  maintainer running the app locally, and must never be set on an instance
  children use.
- **Being signed in as an administrator** shows drafts to that person only,
  wherever they are. A draft has to be readable in its own quiz, its own
  reading page or its own tracing page before anyone can judge whether it is fit
  — reading YAML is not the same as seeing the question a child would get, and a
  path string is not the same as seeing the letter.

Drafts an administrator sees are labelled as drafts, on the question and in the
reading and writing lists, and the subject page says why it looks different from the one a
pupil sees. An unmarked draft would be judged as if it had already passed.

The gate fails closed at every layer: the loaders default to reviewed-only, so a
caller that forgets to ask gets the safe answer. **Note the prerequisite** —
administrator status comes from Pensum's own sign-in, so an instance that
authenticates at a proxy and forwards no identity has no administrators as far
as Pensum is concerned, and nobody sees drafts. See [Accounts and score
history](#accounts-and-score-history).

### Deciding, on the instance

`/{locale}/admin/gjennomgang` lists every authored question, passage and prompt
in one queue — rendered the way a pupil would meet them, because judging a
summary is judging the summary — with **Godkjenn** and **Avvis** on each. It is
behind the same administrator gate as the score pages, and it 404s on an
instance with no database, since a page that cannot record a decision would be a
button that lies.

**A decision is stored in that instance's own database, not in the file it
concerns**, and it overrides `reviewed:` in both directions:

| file says | decision | what a pupil sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reviewed: false` | none | withheld |
| `reviewed: false` | approved | served |
| `reviewed: true` | none | served |
| `reviewed: true` | rejected | withheld |

### Two different questions

The flag and the decision look alike and are not the same judgement. Keeping them
apart is the whole point of putting one in the repository and the other in the
deployment.

- **`reviewed:` in a file asks: has a human read this at all?** It is the floor,
  and it is the same everywhere, because "nobody has checked this yet" is a fact
  about the question rather than about a school.
- **A decision asks: does *this* school want this?** That has no
  repository-wide answer, because it is not a property of the question. It is a
  property of the deployment.

A Pensum serving a Sámi school and a Pensum serving a congregation school in
southern Norway are both running correctly while serving different subsets of the
same repository. Each will want questions the other would rather not put in front
of its pupils, and neither is wrong about its own classroom. A flag in a shared
YAML file cannot express that: it would force whichever school edited it last
onto everyone who pulls the image.

So the difference between the files and a running instance is **not drift to be
reconciled, and there is deliberately no exporter that writes decisions back into
YAML.** Doing that would take one school's local decision and publish it as
everybody's.

The consequence is worth stating plainly: **the repository does not tell you what
a given instance serves.** The files say what Pensum contains and what has been
read; that instance's `content_reviews` says what that school chose from it. To
audit a deployment, look at the deployment — the review page says so on the page
itself.

An instance with no database is unaffected in every respect: no page, no table,
and the file's own flag decides, exactly as before.

## Reading aloud

Norsk and engelsk carry a second exercise: a passage to read out loud. Pensum
times the reading and, when the deployment has speech models, checks it against
the printed text and reports **correct words per minute** — words heard in the
order they were printed, divided by the time spent reading. Plain words per
minute rewards reading fast by skipping, which is the opposite of the point.

The passages are chosen per checkpoint and are ours, like the quiz questions:
LK20 is quoted verbatim elsewhere, and nothing a pupil reads aloud here is
curriculum text — or anybody else's text. Every one of them was written for
Pensum. No lyrics, no subtitles, no excerpts.

**They are deliberately silly.** A sock that runs away to an island, a moose
that swims better than your dad, a formal complaint from a dragon to the
council, terms and conditions for borrowing a pencil. That is not decoration: a
pupil who wants to know how the passage ends reads it to the end, and reading it
to the end is the exercise. The 10. trinn passages get their difficulty from
adult sentence structure and a deadpan register rather than from dry subject
matter — reading bureaucratic prose with a straight face is harder than reading
it fast.

### What a pupil is told

A band, never a threshold — for example *30–60 correct words a minute after 2.
trinn* — followed by the caveat that comes with it. **LK20 sets no words-per-
minute figure and Udir publishes no national norm for reading speed**, so every
band in `data/reading/norms.yaml` is Pensum's own guideline. The schema makes a
band without a cited source impossible to load, and the result page renders the
source's caveat next to the number every time. Reading speed varies enormously
between children who all read perfectly well, and the wording says so.

### What counts as reading it wrong

**Speed is the headline number, and pronunciation is not scored.** Reading
*trappen* for *trappa*, or *boken* for *boka*, is not a reading error — it is
Norwegian, and a recogniser trained on adult speech invents more variation of
the same kind. Alignment therefore treats two words as the same when they share
a stem and differ in the ending, or when they are near-identical throughout.
Reading *hest* for *hus* still counts, and short words are held to an exact
match because that is where a real substitution hides.

The words that were merely pronounced differently are counted and reported
separately, so a pupil can see that their dialect is not what cost them the
percentage.

There is a known cost, recorded in a test rather than hidden: two different
words that share a stem — *store* and *storm* — are accepted as one. Given a
recogniser that mishears children constantly, being wrong in the forgiving
direction is the right way round.

### Three recognisers, and the page says which one is listening

| | Where the audio goes | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **The device's own** | nowhere, on browsers that recognise locally | nothing |
| **Pensum's** | to this server, in memory | models mounted, `WITH_SPEECH=1` |
| **None** | nothing is recorded | nothing |

The browser's `SpeechRecognition` is two products wearing one API: on-device
recognition, where the audio never leaves the handset, and cloud recognition,
where the browser vendor receives a child reading aloud. Pensum cannot tell
which from the server, so the page decides — it uses the first without asking,
because it is strictly more private than posting the audio here, and offers the
second only behind an unticked box that names whose servers are involved.

This is what makes a checked reading possible on the published image, which
ships no models at all: on an iPhone, or a recent Chrome with a local model,
the recognising happens on the device and only the transcript reaches Pensum.
A transcript is also, unavoidably, whatever the page chose to send — a pupil
with developer tools open can claim a flawless reading. That is accepted rather
than defended against; the server path exists for anyone who wants the stricter
answer.

`PENSUM_DEVICE_SPEECH=0` removes the offer entirely.

### Owning the screen

Starting a reading takes over the page. The header, the breadcrumb, the notes
and the footer go; the passage grows to fill the screen with a progress bar and
a clock above it, and the browser is asked for fullscreen on top. `Escape` ends
the reading. None of it is required — with JavaScript off the passage is simply
a passage to read aloud, which is the exercise anyway.

**Words light up as they are read.** While the reading is going, audio is sent
to Pensum in two-second slices; each one is transcribed and matched against the
next stretch of the passage, and the highlight moves forward to wherever the
words were recognised. It runs a beat behind and it only ever moves forward — a
highlight that jumps backwards mid-sentence is worse than one that lags. **The
live pass never touches the score.** It sees eight-second windows with no idea
what came before; the result comes from one pass over the whole recording when
the reading ends.

**Then it plays back.** Whisper reports when each word was heard, so the passage
lights up again at the times the pupil actually read it, with unrecognised words
marked as they pass. A reading nobody listened to replays at an even pace and
the page says that is what it is doing, rather than implying a recording it
never made.

### What it celebrates

Four rewards, and they are not equally defensible:

- **Finishing the passage.** The one badge that cannot mislead: a slow reader
  who reaches the last word earns exactly what a fast one earns.
- **Reaching the band.** Awarded for reaching *or passing* the range for the
  trinn, never for landing inside it — rewarding only the middle would turn a
  guideline into a target with a penalty on both sides.
- **Stars, from accuracy.** Thresholds are deliberately forgiving, and the
  sentence explaining that the recogniser mishears children, dialects and
  second-language speakers is rendered directly underneath rather than in a
  footnote. A reading nobody listened to shows no stars at all.
- **Personal bests and a daily streak.** Computed in the pupil's own browser
  from `localStorage` and never sent anywhere, so Pensum still does not know
  that anyone read the same passage twice.

### Two modes, and only one of them needs configuration

| | Default image | With speech models |
|---|---|---|
| Passage shown, screen taken over | yes | yes |
| Reading timed | yes | yes |
| Checked, if the device recognises speech | yes | yes |
| Audio recorded by Pensum | **no** | in memory, for the length of the reading |
| Words light up live | on-device only | yes |
| Read against the text | no | yes — accuracy, and which words were not heard |
| Replay | even pace, labelled as such | the real times each word was read |
| Stars | no | yes |

The default is the left column. There is no microphone prompt, no recording and
no upload; the page times the reading and says outright that nobody checked it.

Turning on the right column takes a model directory:

```bash
bin/fetch_speech_models                       # ~1 GB, once
PENSUM_SPEECH_MODEL_DIR=/models docker run \
  -e PENSUM_SPEECH_MODEL_DIR=/models \
  -v "$PWD/data/speech:/models:ro" \
  -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/brujoand/pensum:1.0.0
```

The image needs speech support compiled in for this to do anything — build it
with `--build-arg WITH_SPEECH=1`, which adds the `speech` extra. The published
image is built without it.

`PENSUM_SPEECH_LIVE=0` keeps the checking and drops the live highlight. That is
the dial to reach for first under load: lighting words up costs a transcription
every two seconds per pupil reading, on top of the single pass that produces the
score. In-flight readings hold their audio in memory, so concurrency is capped
(32 at once) rather than allowed to grow.

### Where the audio goes

Nowhere. A recording is captured in the page, posted to Pensum's own origin in
slices, held in memory only while the reading is in progress, transcribed by a
model on local disk, and dropped the moment the reading is scored — not on a
timer. It is never written to disk, never sent to a speech API,
never attached to a pupil — signed in or not — and never kept. Transcription is
`faster-whisper` running in-process, so a container with models mounted still
makes no outbound request.

The browser's own `SpeechRecognition` API would have been free and would have
shipped a child's voice to a third-party service. That is why it is not used.

**Vosk is not used either, for a duller reason: it publishes no Norwegian
model.** Some three dozen languages, Swedish the only Nordic one. It could have
served engelsk and nothing else.

## Writing by hand

A third exercise, and the one that wants a touchscreen: trace a letter with a
finger and watch it fill in. Norsk carries the letters, small and capital;
matematikk carries the digits. A first-grader gets one letter at a time — that
is what 1. og 2. trinn is actually doing — and the same machinery takes a whole
word, which is what 3. og 4. trinn will get.

**A letter here is a movement, not a picture.** `data/writing/alphabet.yaml`
holds every glyph as an ordered list of strokes, each an SVG path with a
direction, drawn on a 100×140 grid whose ascender, x-height, baseline and
descender are named in the file. The page rules the paper from those four
numbers, prints a numbered dot where each stroke begins, and can animate any
stroke on request. Where a letter starts and which way it runs is half of what a
six-year-old is learning, and none of it survives being stored as a shape.

The forms are print letters — formskrift, not løkkeskrift — because that is what
Norwegian schools teach first and it is the one a finger on glass can produce.
They are ours: **LK20 says a pupil should write "med funksjonell håndskrift" and
names no letterform at all**, so a school teaching a different `a` is not being
contradicted by this file.

### What is scored

Four measures per stroke, and each one exists because the others can be fooled:

| | catches |
|---|---|
| **Coverage** | a letter half written |
| **Neatness** | ink that wandered off the line |
| **Flow** | a scribble — which covers every point of the guide and never leaves it, so coverage and neatness both call it perfect |
| **Direction** | an `o` drawn the wrong way round: the right shape, the wrong movement |

Plus **economy**, a multiplier comparing ink drawn against line to draw. Going
round an `o` twice to be sure costs nothing; drawing five times the letter is
not writing it.

**Stroke order is scored softly, on purpose.** Writing the crossbar of a `t`
before the stem costs ten percent and can never fail the letter. That is a
judgement about six-year-olds rather than about handwriting: a tool that rejects
a recognisable letter because the strokes came in the wrong order teaches a
child that they cannot write. The result page names the fault instead — *you
went the other way round*, *one stroke is missing* — because that is something
they can do differently next time, where 71% is not.

The tolerance is a fingertip: about a tenth of a letter's width, which is what a
finger actually covers on a phone. The page uses the same figure to decide where
to throw sparks, and a test asserts the two numbers have not drifted apart — a
page kinder than the server would sparkle its way to a disappointing result.

### Where the tracing goes

Nowhere. The points are posted to Pensum's own origin once, when the pupil is
done, marked in memory, and gone with the response. Nothing is written to disk
and nothing is attached to a pupil, signed in or not — the same contract the
reading exercise makes about audio. There is no live endpoint: the browser
already knows where the finger went, so the meter and the sparks are drawn
locally and the server hears about it once.

Like a device reading, everything posted is the page's word. A pupil with the
developer tools open can claim a flawless `Æ` they never drew, and nothing here
can tell. That is accepted rather than defended against, for the same reason as
everywhere else in Pensum: no score is stored, the result is shown to the child
who produced it, and a practice tool that treats its user as an adversary is a
worse practice tool.

### Without JavaScript, it is a worksheet

Every letter of a prompt is rendered server-side, ruled and numbered. With
JavaScript the page shows one at a time and lets a finger draw on it; without,
they all stay on the screen — which prints, and can be traced with a pencil.
That is a worse exercise than the traced one and a much better outcome than an
empty box.

`tools/render_alphabet.py` prints the alphabet as ASCII or as an SVG sheet, with
stroke order and direction marked. A letterform is reviewed by looking at it,
and a path string is not something anyone can review by reading it.

## Listening and spelling

A fourth exercise: a word is read aloud, and the pupil either picks the right
spelling or types it. Norsk and engelsk have it, because they are the subjects
with passages to draw words from.

**Which of the two depends on the checkpoint, not on the pupil.** Up to and
including 2. trinn it is a choice between two spellings, because recognising a
spelling comes a long way before producing one. From 3. trinn it is a box and no
letters to copy from — dictation. A nine-year-old still working towards the 2.
trinn goals gets the 2. trinn exercise, which is the rule the rest of Pensum
follows and for the same reason: the goal set is the thing being practised.

**The browser says the word.** `speechSynthesis`, so no audio is fetched, none
is generated on the server, and there is no microphone anywhere on the page. A
local voice is preferred over a cloud one where the browser offers both, because
a cloud voice sends the word to the browser vendor — an outbound request Pensum
otherwise never makes.

If the browser has no voice for the passage's language, **the exercise refuses to
run and says so**. An English voice reading *kjøleskap* does not say a Norwegian
word badly; it says a different word, and the child is then marked on spelling
something they were never told. Guessing between two spellings with nothing
spoken is a coin toss dressed up as a lesson.

### Nothing is authored twice

There is no `data/listening/`. The words come from the reading passages already
written for that checkpoint — so they are already at its level and already
reviewed — and the wrong spellings are generated.

That is the interesting half. A distractor has to be the word the child might
actually have written:

* **A real word, where the lexicon has one.** `bok`/`bak`, `hus`/`hos`,
  `bruk`/`bråk`. The best kind: both spellings are correct Norwegian, so the
  only way through is to have heard which one was said. About **44%** of
  askable Norwegian words and **38%** of English ones have one.
* **A plausible misspelling for the rest.** *kjøleskapp*, with the doubled
  consonant. Not a word, and precisely the non-word the pupil was at risk of
  writing.

`confusable.py` holds the mistakes, as a short table a teacher can read and
disagree with rather than a phonetic algorithm: kj/skj/sj, silent h and d,
o/å, o/u, e/æ, y/i, voiced against voiceless, and consonant doubling — which in
Norwegian is the commonest spelling error there is.

**What a table cannot know is where in a word a change is possible.** Left alone
it produces *ffølge*, *sdrategi* and *haldvannet*, none of which any child has
written and all of which are spotted without listening — so they make the
exercise easier rather than harder. Two things stop that. Doubling is restricted
to where it means something, between a vowel and either a vowel or the end of
the word; and every invented spelling is checked against the shapes of the
language, measured from the language itself. The lexicon counts which letter
pairs its own words start with, contain and end with, and refuses anything
outside that.

### Where the lexicon comes from

Pensum's own text, and nothing else: every reading passage and both language
halves of every quiz item, which comes to about **4799** Norwegian words
and **3818** English ones. No word list is vendored and none is fetched.

That is a choice with one advantage and one cost. The advantage is that it is
unambiguously ours — a word list is somebody's work and carries somebody's
licence, and this repository is public and ships an image. The cost is density:
a full dictionary would find a real neighbour for nearly every word, where this
finds one for about two in five. `listening/lexicon.py` is the only module that
would have to change if a properly licensed list were ever vendored; it answers
*is this a word* and *does this look like one*, and nothing above it cares how.

Nynorsk has no authored text of its own yet and falls back to the bokmål pool —
wrong in detail, right in effect, where an empty lexicon would silently turn
every distractor into an invention.

### Where the answers go

Nowhere, as with reading and writing. The answers are posted once, marked in
memory, and gone with the response.

The round is **rebuilt on the server** rather than posted back — it is derived
deterministically from the checkpoint, so rebuilding it is cheap, and it means
the questions being marked are the ones the server set rather than the ones the
request claims it was asked.

The words themselves are in the page, because the browser is what says them and
it cannot say a word it has not been given. So a pupil with the developer tools
open can read the answer to a dictation. That is accepted rather than worked
around, for the same reason as everywhere else here: nothing is stored, nothing
is graded, and the alternative — synthesising audio on the server — would mean
shipping a voice per language and would still be beaten by turning the volume up.

Without JavaScript there is no exercise and the page says so. Unlike the writing
screen, there is nothing to fall back to: the word is the exercise, and the
browser is what speaks it.

## Drawing the question

A lot of matematikk is a sentence about an object. *A rectangle is covered by
equal squares; there are 3 rows of 4* is twenty words a seven-year-old has to
decode before they can start counting, and a question about the area of a
triangle asks a ten-year-old to hold a shape in their head that the page could
simply have shown them. A quiz item can therefore carry a **figure**, drawn
above its answers.

Five kinds, chosen from what the committed questions actually describe:

| | for | shows |
|---|---|---|
| `shape` | geometry | a named plane figure, with sides, vertices, right angles and an altitude labelled as a textbook labels them |
| `counters` | counting, grouping | dots to count, optionally split into equal groups or partly filled in |
| `array` | area, multiplication | a rectangle made of unit squares — the one figure drawn to scale, because its cells can be counted |
| `fraction` | parts of a whole | one to four wholes as bars or as circles, cut into equal parts with some of them shaded |
| `number_line` | counting on and back, place value | a ruled line with marks, and jumps drawn as directed arcs above it |

**A figure is declared, not drawn.** An item names a kind and its parameters:
`parts: 4, shaded: 1` is either one quarter or it is a typo somebody can see.
Nothing in the data is an SVG path or a markup fragment. That is the reverse of
the decision the alphabet makes, and for the same reason — a letterform *is* its
path, so it is authored as one, whereas nobody can review `M20,20L180,180`
against the sentence it is supposed to illustrate.

The geometry is arithmetic in `pensum/items/figures.py`, and the template loops
over the paths, dots and labels it produces. So the drawing is asserted in tests
rather than inspected in a browser: that 2/4 shades the same width as 1/2, that
a square is drawn square, that a jump backwards points left.

```bash
uv run python tools/render_figures.py > /tmp/figures.html    # every committed figure
uv run python tools/render_figures.py --gallery > /tmp/g.html  # one of each kind
```

The first sheet puts each figure under the prompt it belongs to, which is the
only way to answer the question a reviewer actually has: does the picture say
the same thing as the words? The second ignores the data and draws every shape
and option, including the ones no item uses yet — that is the sheet to look at
after changing the geometry.

### What a figure may and may not give away

**A figure may show what the prompt already says. It may not show anything the
prompt withholds.** A question that names a chocolate bar in eight pieces can be
drawn as eight pieces; a question asking which of two triangles has the longer
side cannot be drawn with one of them visibly longer, because then the picture
is the answer and the question is gone. This is a judgement per item, and it is
the thing to check when reviewing one.

**Alt text says what is drawn, including what a sighted reader would have to
count.** The alternative is a coy description that leaves a screen-reader user
holding an unanswerable question, which is worse than telling them. Every figure
carries its alt text in both UI locales, and no figure loads without one.

**No figure carries a colour.** Every stroke and fill comes from the same
stylesheet variables the rest of the page uses, so dark mode and a high-contrast
setting reach a figure without it knowing they exist, and no single question can
opt itself out. A test asserts the rendered markup has no `fill`, no `stroke`
and no hex colour in it.

**It is plain SVG, rendered server-side, and needs no script.** For several of
these questions the picture is half of the prompt, and half a prompt that
appears only when JavaScript does is not a prompt.

**A figure inherits its item's review state**, because it is part of the
question rather than an illustration beside it. Adding one to a question that
was already reviewed changes what that question tests, so it wants the reviewer
back — `tools/render_figures.py` is what to hand them.

## Development

```bash
mise install
uv sync --group dev --group ingest
uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Running it locally:

```bash
bin/run_local              # build the image and run it on :8000
bin/run_local --native     # run from source with reload, no Docker
bin/run_local --no-build   # reuse the image you already built
bin/run_local --port 9000
```

### Keeping dependencies current

Renovate opens the update PRs, configured in `.renovaterc.json5`. Nothing
automerges — every bump is assigned to a human — and releases sit for a week
before they are offered, so a bad publish upstream has time to be yanked.

Three groupings exist because three things are pinned in more than one place
and silently break when they drift apart:

- **uv** — `mise.toml` is what a developer and CI run; the Dockerfile copies the
  same version out of the official image. Merged apart, the image gets built by
  a uv the tests never saw.
- **Shell tooling** — `mise.toml` installs shellcheck and shfmt for
  `bin/run_local`; `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins its own copies. When they
  disagree, pre-commit passes locally and fails in CI.
- **Python** — pinned in `mise.toml`, floored in `pyproject.toml`, set by the
  base image. Patch releases move all three together; a new minor is disabled,
  because that is a decision about what the project supports rather than an
  update.

One consequence is worth knowing before it surprises you: a **runtime**
dependency bump lands as `fix(deps)`, which semantic-release reads as a patch
and turns into a tagged release and a published image. That is intended — a
patched dependency should reach the image without a hand-written commit. Dev and
CI dependencies land as `chore(deps)` and publish nothing.

### Keeping the curriculum current

Udir revises curricula on their own schedule, and a revision **renumbers every
competence goal** — which orphans every quiz item keyed to the old codes. The
committed data gives no sign of this by itself: it stays valid-looking
indefinitely. So noticing is automated.

```bash
uv run pensum-ingest --check-drift      # what has changed upstream? (read-only)
uv run pensum-ingest --as-of 2026-08-01 # re-vendor; writes data/curriculum/
```

`--check-drift` reads only Udir's index endpoint, so it is cheap enough to run
weekly — which it does, via `.github/workflows/curriculum-drift.yml`, opening an
issue when something needs attention. It reports four things: a subject revised
upstream, one expiring or expired, one withdrawn, and one **superseded by a newer
revision**.

That last check is inferred from a higher revision number appearing upstream
rather than read directly, because the index endpoint carries no `erstattes-av`.
It has to be: NOR01-07 was replaced by NOR01-08 while carrying no expiry date at
all, so a newer revision in the index is the *only* signal that the vendored copy
is stale.

Re-ingesting is deliberately a human decision, not an automated PR — a revision
reworks goal wording and moves checkpoints, so items need re-authoring rather
than a rubber-stamped merge. The output is sorted and stable, so the change
arrives as a readable diff, and that diff is the review artifact.

Udir is the single source of truth: nothing under `data/curriculum/` is
hand-authored or hand-edited, so the whole catalogue can always be re-derived
and re-verified against the official source.

## Honest limits

- **Not every competence goal can be tested in writing.** Many are framed as
  *utforske*, *samtale om*, *delta i* — things a pupil does, not things a quiz
  can check. Pensum marks those as not assessable and shows them without
  quizzing them, rather than inventing a question that misrepresents the goal.
  Coverage is therefore uneven by design.
- **Quiz questions are drafted with an LLM and reviewed by hand.** Questions are
  committed as readable YAML so every one of them is reviewable, and nothing is
  served until a human has signed it off — either in the file, or on the review
  page, which records the decision in the database rather than the file. The
  curriculum text itself is never generated — it is quoted verbatim from Udir.
- **A reading speed is a guideline, and a rough one.** No words-per-minute
  figure appears anywhere in LK20, and Udir publishes no national norm for
  reading speed, so the bands in `data/reading/norms.yaml` are Pensum's own and
  are shown with that stated. A speech recogniser also mishears children,
  dialects and second-language speakers more than it mishears anyone else, so a
  word listed as "not heard" may be the machine's mistake rather than the
  pupil's — which the result page says as well.
- **The reading screen is gamified, and two of its rewards are in tension with
  everything above.** Stars come from a recogniser that is least accurate for
  the pupils they would most discourage, and rewarding a words-per-minute band
  makes a target of a range the norms file explicitly says is not one. They are
  built the least harmful way we could — forgiving thresholds, the caveat next
  to the stars, credit for reaching the band rather than for landing inside it,
  no stars at all when nothing was listened to — but the tension is real and is
  recorded here rather than smoothed over.
- **A traced letter is not handwriting.** The writing exercise measures where a
  fingertip went on glass, which is a blunter instrument than a pencil and a
  different motion from holding one. It can tell that a letter was formed from
  the right strokes, in roughly the right places, in roughly the right order; it
  cannot tell whether a child can write. Handwriting is learned with a pencil and
  an adult beside you, and the result page says so under every score.
- **A generated wrong spelling is not a curriculum, and the lexicon is small.**
  The listening exercise builds its distractors from a short table of the
  mistakes Norwegian and English children make, checked against Pensum's own
  vocabulary of a few thousand words. Where that vocabulary has no real
  near-word — about three cases in five — the distractor is an invented
  misspelling, which is a good wrong answer rather than a great one. And the
  words are whatever the reading passages happen to contain, so the exercise
  practises spelling patterns without covering them: it is not a spelling
  syllabus and does not claim to be one.
- **Whether the word can be heard at all depends on the device.** The voice is
  the browser's own. A machine with no Norwegian voice installed gets no
  Norwegian exercise, and Pensum says so rather than reading the word in
  whatever voice it has.
- **No accounts and no analytics unless a deployment adds them.** Out of the
  box Pensum stores nothing about who is using it: quiz progress lives in memory
  for the length of a session and is gone afterwards, and there is no third-party
  script on any page in any configuration. A deployment can enable sign-in and
  keep a score history — see [Accounts and score
  history](#accounts-and-score-history) for exactly what that stores and what it
  still refuses to. Reading aloud is the one feature that handles audio, and it
  keeps none of it: see [Where the audio goes](#where-the-audio-goes), and the
  writing exercise keeps no tracing either. If you run the published image with
  no environment set, none of it applies to you.

## Licence

Every page links to **[Rights and takedowns](#rights-and-takedowns)** in its
footer, at `/{locale}/rettigheter`. It names the three owners below and gives an
address to write to; `PENSUM_DMCA_EMAIL` overrides that address so a fork gets
its own inbox.

### Rights and takedowns

Three kinds of content, three owners:

- **Curriculum text** is Udir's, reproduced verbatim under NLOD.
- **Quiz questions and reading passages** were written for Pensum. None is
  taken from a book, lyric, subtitle or other work, and all of them are
  committed as readable text so anyone can check that claim rather than take it.
- **The code** is MIT.

If you believe something here is yours, write to the address on that page with
what it is, where you saw it, who you are and why. The content comes down while
it is looked at. "DMCA" is the name most people know the process by; Pensum is a
Norwegian project and a request is handled under Norwegian law, but nobody needs
to know that to send an email.

Reading audio is not covered by any of this, because none of it is kept: a
recording is processed in memory while the pupil waits and is gone with the
response, so there is nothing to request access to or deletion of.

The code is MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The curriculum data under `data/curriculum/` is not ours. It is redistributed
under **NLOD**, the Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data, which permits
copying, redistribution, modification and commercial use, and requires the
source to be credited:

> Inneholder data under [NLOD](https://data.norge.no/nlod/no),
> tilgjengeliggjort på [data.udir.no](https://data.udir.no).
>
> Contains data under [NLOD](https://data.norge.no/nlod/en), made available on
> [data.udir.no](https://data.udir.no).

Two conditions of that licence shape how Pensum is built, not just how it is
credited:

- **The data must not be presented in a misleading or distorted manner.** So
  competence-goal text is shown verbatim, never paraphrased or summarised, and
  is always visually distinct from quiz questions — which are ours, not Udir's.
  Each goal links to its official source record so any claim we make about the
  curriculum can be checked against it.
- **Udir's logo may not be used** without a separate agreement. Pensum does not
  use it, and displays nothing implying official endorsement.
