"""Finding a pupil's ceiling by bisecting a subject's ladder.

A trinntest asks a fixed question -- "can you pass 6. trinn i matte?" -- and
answers it against one checkpoint. A nivåtest asks the open one: what level is
this pupil actually at? It asks a block of questions at one rung, then halves
whatever span is still unknown, until it holds a checkpoint the pupil clears and
the next one they do not. Those two rungs are the answer.

**Why not item response theory.** IRT is the standard tool here and it is the
wrong one for us: it needs item parameters fitted to real response data, and we
have none. Our `difficulty` field is one author's guess made at authoring time.
Fitting a latent-ability model to guesses yields a number with a decimal point
and a confidence interval that means nothing at all, which is worse than a coarse
answer honest about being coarse. Bisection resolves to one Udir checkpoint,
which is exactly the resolution the curriculum itself defines, and it can be
explained to a parent in one sentence: it asks in the middle of whatever is
still unknown.

**Why bisection rather than a staircase.** A one-rung-at-a-time walk is the
obvious design and it does not fit the budget. Matematikk has nine rungs, and a
pupil who starts more than four away from their real level runs out of questions
just as it is about to be found -- measured at 38% of simulated pupils placed
inconclusively. Halving the remaining span brackets every ladder we have for
every pupil who clears anything at all, in at most four blocks.

**Why it terminates.** Each block is asked strictly inside the open span between
the highest rung cleared and the lowest rung failed, and afterwards becomes one
of those two bounds. The span therefore shrinks every step, and the walk stops
when nothing is left between them. The item budget is a second, independent
backstop.

Pure state machine. It decides *which rung to ask next and how many items*; it
does not pick items, hold a session, or know about the web layer.
