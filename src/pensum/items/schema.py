"""Quiz item schema.

Items are ours, not Udir's. Competence goals say what a pupil should be able to
do; turning that into a question is authorship, and the result must never be
mistakable for official curriculum text.

Two properties are load-bearing:

  * An item names the competence goal it tests. A curriculum revision renumbers
    goal codes, so this is what makes orphaned items a loud CI failure rather
    than a silent one.
  * A goal may honestly have no items. Many kompetansemaal describe things a
    pupil *does* -- utforske, samtale om, delta i -- which no written question
    can check. Recording that as `not_assessable` keeps coverage honest;
    inventing a proxy question would misrepresent the goal.
