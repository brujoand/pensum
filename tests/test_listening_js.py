"""The browser half of the listening exercise.

`listening.js` chooses the voice, and that choice is the one thing on the page
that can be wrong without looking wrong: an English voice reading "kjøleskap"
says a different word, and the child is then marked on spelling something they
were never told.

The checks live in `tests/js/listening_voice.test.js` because they have to run
the real JavaScript. This shells out to node and reports what it said -- and
adds the checks that cannot live on either side alone: that the page and the
server agree about how many answers a round has and how long one may be.
