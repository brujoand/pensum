"""Signed cookies: who is signed in, and one in-flight login.

Both cookies are signed and read back with a maximum age, and neither is ever
trusted as an identifier on its own -- a tampered or stale cookie reads as "not
signed in", which is the same state a first-time visitor is in.

Server-side session storage would be the alternative. It is not worth it here: a
name and a group list are all that is kept, the provider remains the authority
on both, and a signed cookie means a restart does not log out a room full of
children.
