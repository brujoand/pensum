"""FastAPI application factory.

The catalogue loads once at startup and is then immutable. There is no database
behind the curriculum: the whole dataset is a few megabytes of vendored JSON, and
keeping it in memory means a page load touches no network and no disk.

Three optional subsystems attach here, all off unless configured: sign-in
against an OIDC provider, a SQLite file of finished attempts, and the speech
models that turn a reading from timed into checked. With none of them set --
which is what `docker run` with no environment gives you -- this is the app that
stores nothing about anybody and makes no outbound request.
