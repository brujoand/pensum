"""The ordered checkpoints a pupil can be measured against, per subject.

A nivåtest asks "what level is this pupil actually at?", and the only honest
answer LK20 supports is one of its own checkpoints. So the ladder is not a scale
we invented -- it is the subject's kompetansemaalsett, sorted.

The shape differs per subject, and that is not an inconsistency to smooth over:

    matematikk                          9 rungs -- etter 2., 3., ... 10. trinn
    norsk/engelsk/naturfag/samfunnsfag  4 rungs -- roughly 2., 4., 7., 10.
    KRLE                                3 rungs -- etter 4., 7., 10.

A matematikk result therefore resolves to a single school year while a KRLE
result resolves to a three-year span. The UI has to say which it is rather than
implying both are "level 3 of N".

`difficulty` on a quiz item deliberately plays no part here. `pensum.items.schema`
defines it as relative to its checkpoint -- a hard 2.-trinn item is not a hard
10.-trinn item -- so it cannot order anything across rungs. The rung is the
ladder; difficulty is grain within one.

Pure: no I/O and no item loading. Callers pass in which goal sets are servable,
because "is there a quiz for this checkpoint?" is a question about the item bank,
not about the curriculum.
