"""Reading-aloud routes.

Four things happen here and it is worth being explicit about which:

* the passage is shown, which needs nothing;
* the reading is timed, which needs only a clock in the page;
* the words light up as they are read, which needs the audio to arrive in
  pieces and a speech model to transcribe each piece; and
* the reading is checked against the passage, which needs the same model over
  the whole recording.

Only the last two are optional, and their absence is the default. A deployment
with no models still gets a working reading exercise -- it reports a pace rather
than an accuracy, replays the passage at an even pace rather than at the times
the words were actually read, and says so on the page.

The recording is decoded in memory and discarded with the reading. It is never
written to disk, never forwarded anywhere, and never associated with a pupil,
whether or not they are signed in.
