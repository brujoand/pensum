"""The admin view of recorded scores.

Two pages: who has taken quizzes, and how one of them has done. Both are behind
`require_admin`, and both exist only when score history is configured -- there is
no page here that renders an empty table as though the feature were merely
unused.

The pages are read-only by design. An admin can see a score; there is nothing
here to edit, re-grade or delete a child's record with, because none of those
would be an improvement on `sqlite3 pensum.db`.
