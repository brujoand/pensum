"""Nivåtest routes -- the adaptive test that looks for a pupil's ceiling.

Deliberately a separate router from `quiz_routes`, because the two answer
different questions and should be able to diverge. What they must *not* diverge
on is the question loop itself, so both render `partials/question.html` and
`partials/feedback.html` through `rendering.flow`.

One asymmetry is visible in the URLs and is intentional: a trinntest is started
from a grade and a subject, because the pupil already knows which checkpoint
they mean. A nivåtest is started from a subject alone -- picking the checkpoint
is the thing it is for -- and the klasse it asks for is a hint about where to
begin, never a claim about where they will end up.
