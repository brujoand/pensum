"""The bracket search behind the nivåtest.

The claim this module makes about a child -- "you are working at 4.-trinn level"
-- is the strongest thing Pensum says to anyone, so the tests are mostly about
the ways it must refuse to say it: when the budget ran out mid-climb, when the
pupil cleared nothing, when the ladder simply ended.

The simulation at the bottom is the load-bearing one. It plays every possible
pupil against every real subject and asserts the walk both terminates and lands
on the right rung.
