"""Surface what a human reviewer should look at first.

Not a substitute for reading the questions -- nothing is. This finds the classes
of defect that are mechanically detectable, so a reviewer's attention goes to
the ones that are not: whether the question is fair, age-appropriate, and
actually tests the goal rather than the reading.
