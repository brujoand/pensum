"""Loading letterforms and prompts from disk.

Same shape as `pensum.items.loader` and `pensum.reading.library`, deliberately:
one YAML file per checkpoint, loaded once at startup, immutable afterwards, and
a prompt no human has read is withheld under the same switch that withholds an
unreviewed quiz item.

The alphabet sits beside them rather than inside them. It is one file for the
whole application because a letter is not owned by a subject.
