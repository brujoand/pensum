"""Runtime configuration.

Everything has a working default. The container must start with no environment
set at all -- and when it does, Pensum behaves exactly as it always has: no
sign-in, nothing written to disk, nothing recorded about anyone.

Two optional subsystems change that, and both are off unless explicitly
configured:

* **Sign-in** turns on when an OIDC issuer, client id and client secret are all
  present. Signing in is never required -- an anonymous pupil gets the same quiz
  and is still not recorded.
* **Score history** turns on when a database path is set. Only attempts by a
  signed-in pupil are ever written, so the two switches are independent but only
  useful together.

Keeping both off by default is what keeps "the public image needs no
configuration and stores nothing" structurally true rather than documented.
