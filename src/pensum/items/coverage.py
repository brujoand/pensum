"""How much of a checkpoint a quiz actually reaches.

Many competence goals cannot be tested in writing -- exploring, discussing,
making something. Those are recorded as not assessable rather than quizzed, so a
checkpoint's quiz honestly covers only part of its curriculum. This turns that
fact into something the page can show, so "can you pass 2. klasse?" does not
quietly overstate itself.

Pure, so it is testable without the web layer.
