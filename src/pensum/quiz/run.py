"""A nivåtest in flight: the bracket search, plus the questions it has drawn.

`pensum.quiz.placement` decides *which rung to ask next and how many items*.
This is what turns that into a sitting: it draws a block, hands the pupil one
question at a time, scores the block when it is done, feeds the result back to
the search, and draws whatever comes next. The pupil sees an ordinary quiz; the
rung is moving underneath them.

Two properties are worth stating outright, because both are easy to lose:

  * **A question is never asked twice in one run.** Every id drawn is remembered
    and excluded from later draws. The frontier rung gets deepened, so without
    this the second block there would re-serve what the first already asked --
    and the banks are shallow enough that it would happen constantly (see the
    per-rung depth issue).
  * **The run does not know how long it is.** That is inherent to an adaptive
    test and not a defect to paper over: showing a progress bar out of a total
    we have not decided yet would be a lie. `asked` is honest; there is no
    `total`.

Item drawing is injected rather than imported. The web layer passes a callable
backed by the `ItemBank`; tests pass a fake. This module therefore has no I/O
and no idea where questions come from.
