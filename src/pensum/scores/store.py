"""Where finished attempts are kept.

SQLite, from the standard library. The whole dataset is one row per quiz a child
finishes -- a family's worth of that is measured in kilobytes per year, and a
single file that can be copied, inspected with `sqlite3` and deleted by hand is
the right shape for data about children.

What is stored is deliberately the summary, not the transcript: which checkpoint,
how many right, and the per-goal tally the result page already shows. Not which
answer was given to which question. The tally is what an adult can act on; the
transcript is a record of a seven-year-old's mistakes, and Pensum has no use for
it that justifies keeping it.
